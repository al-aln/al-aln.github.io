# Slime Souls

A simple yet fun 2D platformer I created using Scratch.

## Game Description

In Slime Souls, you play as a lovable slime who must navigate through treacherous terrain to reach the end goal. The twist? Knights are trying to stop you! Collecting coins and defeating enemies earns you points, but beware - there's a final boss at the end that'll put your skills to the test.

## Gameplay

As you navigate through the levels, be sure to grab those coins and take down any knights that get in your way. But don't forget - there's a final boss waiting for you at the end! With every point you earn, you'll get closer to defeating that pesky boss.

## Conclusion

Slime Souls is a fun little game I made using Scratch. If you're interested in playing, be sure to check out my project on (game_link).
